# TLT536-EVM

The TLT536-EVM is an industrial evaluation board based on the Allwinner T536MX-CEN2/T536MX-CXX four-core ARM Cortex-A55 + Xuantie E907 RISC-V heterogeneous multi-core processor design, with the ARM Cortex-A55 core clocked up to 1.6GHz. The evaluation board consists of a core board and an evaluation baseboard. All components on the core board, including the CPU, ROM, RAM, power supply, crystal oscillator, and others, are based on industrial-grade solutions.

The core board undergoes professional PCB layout and high/low temperature testing to ensure stability and reliability. It supports optional shielding and can meet various industrial application environment requirements.

The evaluation board is equipped with a rich set of interface resources, including 13 UART ports (6 RS485, 2 RS232, 4 TTL UART, 1 Debug UART), 4 CAN-FD ports, 4 Ethernet ports, 3 USB2.0 ports, and Local Bus interfaces. It also provides HDMI OUT, LVDS LCD, MIPI LCD, HP OUT/MIC IN, and other audio and video multimedia interfaces. The board integrates a 2TOPS NPU, 8M@30fps ISP, and supports 4K@25fps H.264 video encoding.

The evaluation board features an onboard WiFi/Bluetooth dual-module and supports optional 4G/5G modules, NVMe solid-state drives, PLP power loss protection modules, and more. It can also be configured with a protective enclosure for direct use in industrial environments, allowing users to quickly evaluate product solutions and conduct technical research.
