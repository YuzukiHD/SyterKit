 * @brief Perform a backtrace to find the call stack.

 * leading to the current execution point.
 * 
 * The backtrace process works by using the stack and link register to trace the call hierarchy,
 * logging each level of the backtrace, and attempting recovery from any errors.
 * If the backtrace from the stack fails, it will attempt to trace using the link register (LR).
 * 
 * @param PC The current program counter (PC), typically pointing to the instruction where the backtrace starts.
 * @param SP The current stack pointer (SP), pointing to the top of the stack.
 * @param LR The link register (LR), used to store return addresses for function calls.
 * 
 * @return The number of backtrace levels successfully traversed. 
 *         Returns 0 if no valid backtrace could be performed.

 * The function also checks if the processor is in THUMB mode based on the CPSR state and adjusts
 * the program counter (PC) accordingly. If the program counter or stack pointer is invalid, 
 * the function will return early with a status of 0.
